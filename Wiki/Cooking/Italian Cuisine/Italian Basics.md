# Italian Cuisine Basics

## Battuto
A finely chopped mix of vegetables and herbs. Usually Garlic, celery, carrot, onion, parsley, olive oil

## Soffritto
Once a battuto is saut√©ed in a skillet, it turns into a soffritto. For best results, onion should be added first. Once translucent, the garlic is added. Once the garlic is colored, the rest of the ingredients are added. If the recipe calls for panchetta, add it with the onion.
