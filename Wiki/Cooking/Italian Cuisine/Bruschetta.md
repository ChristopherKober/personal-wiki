# Bruschetta
## Roman Garlic Bread
DIRECTLY from the Latin verb and into the modern vernacular of Rome comes the verb bruscare, which means to toast (as in a slice of bread), or roast (as with coffee beans); hence bruschetta, whose most important component, aside from the grilled bread itself, is olive oil.

On those brisk days that bridge the passage from fall to winter, and signal the release of the year’s freshly pressed olive oil, toasting bread over a smoky fire and soaking it with spicy, laser-green newly minted oil is a practice probably as old as Rome itself. From Rome bruschetta spread through the rest of central Italy—Umbria, Tuscany, Abruzzi—and acquired other ingredients: invariably now, garlic and, here and there, tomatoes. Two versions of bruschetta follow.

## Basic Bruchetta
 For 6 to 12 servings
 -  6 garlic cloves
 -  12 slices good, thick-crusted bread, 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch thick, 3 to 4 inches wide
 -  Extra virgin olive oil, fruity and young
 -  Salt
 -  Black pepper, ground fresh from the mill

1. Preheat a broiler or, even better, light a charcoal fire.
2. Mash the garlic cloves with a heavy knife handle, crushing them just enough to split them and to loosen the peel, which you will remove and discard.
3. Grill the bread to a golden brown on both sides.
4. As the bread comes off the grill, while it is still hot, rub one side of each slice with the mashed garlic.
5. Put the bread on a platter, garlicky side facing up, and pour a thin stream of olive oil over each slice, enough to soak it lightly.
6. Sprinkle with salt and a few grindings of pepper. Serve while still warm.

## Tomato Version
- All ingredients above
- 8 fresh, ripe plum tomatoes
- 8 to 12 fresh basil leaves

1. Wash the tomatoes, split them in half lengthwise, and with the tip of a paring knife pick out all the seeds you can. Dice the tomatoes into 1⁄2-inch cubes.
2. Wash the basil leaves, shake them thoroughly dry, and tear them into small pieces.
3. After rubbing the hot grilled bread with garlic as directed in recipe above, top it with diced tomato, sprinkle with basil or oregano, add salt and pepper, and lightly drizzle each slice with olive oil. Serve while still warm.
